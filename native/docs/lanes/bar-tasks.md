# Lane notes: native-bar-tasks (R3-1)

## Part 1 (this branch, native/r3-tasks)

Data side, `Mantle.Core/Features/`:

- `Pinned/PinnedReader.cs`, `LnkFile.cs`: lib/pinned.js ported (folder list, Taskband Favorites order through the
  sidecar `pins` or the byte search, sidecar `lnk` else the built-in MS-SHLLINK reader, `app` once per Store pin,
  every reason and note in Electron's words). Read only.
- `Pinned/PinOverlay.cs`: the read side of lib/features/_jumplist-pins.js (`features\jumplist.json` "pins": hide, add,
  order; norm, byOrder, sameApp) and the session's running order (`RunningOrder`). Writing it (pin, unpin, undo, a
  dragged order) is part 2.
- `WindowList/RunningWindows.cs`: withoutMantle (plus native's own MantleNative.exe shell and pop-up windows),
  groupRunning (AUMID first, exe second), nameForExe.
- `WindowList/TaskStrip.cs`: buildPinned (pins claim their group, running-only apps after), `TaskOpen` (bar.open,
  bar.window, the test dry run).
- `WindowList/TaskStripService.cs`: the host side on the platform: the `windows` push (one `windows` call if none
  arrived), pushes at most once a second with reasons merged, the 5 min clean pins cache, the pins folder watch
  (500 ms debounce, 30 s re-arm), `appchanged`, the "incomplete / complete again" log lines.
- `Icons/IconCache.cs`: lib/icon-fresh.js and main.js#iconFor (sidecar `icon` / `app`, an unreachable sidecar keeps
  the old picture).

Strip, `Mantle.App/Surfaces/Bar/Tasks/`:

- `BarTasksHost.cs`: UI <-> host bridge; `BarTaskActions` (live: sidecar focus/minimize/close/launch with the
  foreground grant; test and scratch: focus and minimise in-process on the UI thread, launch = dry run).
- `BarWindow.Tasks.cs`: `CellVm` and the strip (icon from the sidecar's PNG data URL or the letter tile, the 6x3 /
  16x3 accent running line, the 1x22 hairline before the first running-only app, tooltip, middle-click = fresh,
  chips "Some apps still loading" / "Apps not shown" / "Open windows not updating" / "App did not open"), cells.json.
- `TasksWiring.cs`: STAND-IN for the requested App.xaml.cs line (see the file).

Test runs never read the user's pins: `MANTLE_TEST_PINS_DIR` (a scratch TaskBar folder) and
`MANTLE_TEST_TASKBAND_KEY` (a scratch key under HKCU holding a `Favorites` REG_BINARY). Without them a test or
scratch run shows no pins and says why in the strip's reason. Electron's `--test` reads the real pins; this is a
deliberate deviation for safety.

## Part 2 starts here

Window previews (DWM thumbnails, BAR-221..234, 308..314), the window list for action `list`, drag to reorder
(BAR-239..254) with the overlay writes, the jump list / app menu (BAR-207..220, 315..332), overflow "+N"
(BAR-235..238), badges (Helm count BAR-255..257, keep on top BAR-258, 333..347), Mantle apps standing in for
Windows' (BAR-291..296), the top bar hide rows (348..351), the parity strip screenshots
(`native/tools/parity/bar-tasks/`), and PEND-011.
